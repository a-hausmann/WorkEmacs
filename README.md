# WorkEmacs
Custom config created for work Windows laptop where McAfee prevents use-package from working.

This config set is mostly pulled from the myDotemacs repository code, and eventually will be broken down into several Elisp modules collecting like packages together. Will use namespace prefix of "we/" for WorkEmacs for functions, and modules will use "we-" prefix.  Work begun on 8/25/2022.
